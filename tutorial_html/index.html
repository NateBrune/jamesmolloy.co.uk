	<h1>Roll your own toy UNIX-clone OS</h1>
	<p>This set of tutorials aims to take you through programming a simple UNIX-clone operating system for the x86 
architecture.
	The tutorial uses C as the language of choice, with liberally mixed in bits of assembler. The aim is to talk you through 
	the design and implementation decisions in making an operating system. The OS we make is monolithic in design (drivers are 
	loaded through kernel-mode modules as opposed to user-mode programs), as this is simpler.</p>

	<p>This set of tutorials is very practical in nature. The theory is given in every section, but the majority of the 
tutorial deals with getting dirty and implementing the abstract ideas and mechanisms discussed everywhere. It is important to 
note that the kernel implemented is a <b>teaching kernel</b>. I <b>know</b> that the algorithms used are not the most space 
efficient or optimal. They normally are chosen for their simplicity and ease of understanding.The aim of this is to get you into 
the correct 
mindset, and to give you a grounding 
upon which 
you can 
work. The kernel given is extensible, and good algorithms can easily be plugged in.If you have problems 
with the theory, there are plenty of sites that would be delighted to help you (most questions on OSDev forums are concerned with 
implementation - "My gets function doesn't work! help!" - A theory question is a breath of fresh air to many ;) ). Links can be 
found at the bottom of the page.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To compile and run the sample code I provide requires just GCC, ld, NASM and GNU Make. NASM is an open-source x86 assembler, 
and is the assembler-of-choice for many x86 OS-devs.</p>

<p>There is no point, however, in just compiling and running without comprehension. You must <i>understand</i> what is being 
coded, and as such you should have a very strong knowledge of C, especially regarding pointers. You should also know a little bit 
of assembly (Intel syntax is used in these tutorials), including what the EBP register is used for.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>There are plenty of resources out there if you <a href="http://www.google.com">know where to look</a>. In particular, you 
should find these useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/index.htm">RTFM!</a> The intel manuals are a godsend</li>
<li><a href="http://www.osdev.org/wiki">The osdev.org wiki</a> and <a href="http://www.osdev.org/forum">forums</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.osdever.net">Osdever.net</a> has many good tutorials and papers, and in particular
<a href="http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/index.php">Bran's kernel development tutorials</a>, which some of the earlier code from 
this tutorial is based off. (I myself used these tutorials to get started, and the code is so good I haven't had to change it over 
the years</li>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/alt.os.development/topics">alt.os.development</a> can answer many of your non-n00b 
questions. N00b questions are better asked on the osdever.net forums.</li>
</ul>
